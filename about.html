                This module provides a series of articles that will help you master HTML
                forms. HTML forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users;
                however, for historical and technical reasons, it's not always obvious
                how to use them to their full potential. In this guide, we'll cover all
                aspects of HTML forms, from structure to styling, from data handling to
                custom widgets.
